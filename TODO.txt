- pretty symlinks for users
- check for free space
- make list command show snapshots as a tree. Maybe optional
- investigate rsync option -y, --fuzzy
- how to deal with oldest snapshot?
  - special prune for highest interval:
    - by free block/inode space
    - option "-keepOldest":
        wether to keep the oldest snapshot (thus being able to go back to the beginning)
        or not, saving disk space.
- think about if it is useful to add the full origin path name to the repository subdirs
- regularly log memory stats
- deal with negative time shifts in transComplete()
- user configurable schedules? Or many predefined ones?
- subcommand "schedule" to show details about schedules:
  - expected number of snapshots
  - expected disk usage, given a start value + daily changes
- handle errors in RemoveAll (no write permission, what to do?)
