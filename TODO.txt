- pretty symlinks for users
- check for free space
- signal handling
  - need to send SIGTERM twice within e. g. 3 seconds in order to quit
    immediately, otherwise quit after finishing all tasks
- make sure only a single instance is running at a time
- make list command show snapshots as a tree. Maybe optional
- investigate rsync option -y, --fuzzy
- fix "latest" link after pruning
- make "latest" symlink relative
- how to deal with oldest snapshot?
  - special prune for highest interval:
    - by free block/inode space
    - option "-maxKeep":
        how many snapshot to keep in highest interval
    - option "-keepOldest":
        wether to keep the oldest snapshot (thus being able to go back to the beginning)
        or not, saving disk space.
- when restarting snaprd after a while, it will obsolete many snapshots.
  This is okay, as long as the deletion will be more conservative
- make purge() pick up STATE_INDELETION snapshots

states:

-complete
-incomplete
-obsolete
-purging
