- pretty symlinks for users
- check for free space
- signal handling
  - need to send SIGTERM twice within e. g. 3 seconds in order to quit
    immediately, otherwise quit after finishing all tasks
- make sure only a single instance is running at a time
- make list command show snapshots as a tree. Maybe optional
- investigate rsync option -y, --fuzzy
- how to deal with oldest snapshot?
  - special prune for highest interval:
    - by free block/inode space
    - option "-keepOldest":
        wether to keep the oldest snapshot (thus being able to go back to the beginning)
        or not, saving disk space.
- what happens when restarting snaprd after a while:
  - it will obsolete many snapshots. This is okay, as long as the deletion will be more conservative
  - waiting time for next snapshot should be adjusted accordingly.
     - Maybe use a waiting_time channel?
- start first snapshot immediately, if that makes sense
- think about if it is useful to add the full origin path name to the repository subdirs
- defined exit status of snaprd
- forward signals to children as appropriate
- regularly log memory stats
- cache schedule in repository
  - try to load json file from repository
  - if found, set config from it
  - then overwrite options from command line parameters
  - then write out config struct to the file again

bugs:

- *Snapshot.period does not work as expected: it does not return all snapshots that it should return,
  at least not in the case "there is only one snapshot"

- SIGBUS error!?

- handle errors in RemoveAll (no write permission, what to do?)
